## **Project: Blockchain from Scratch in Golang**

### **1. Core Components of the Blockchain**
A blockchain consists of a series of blocks, each containing transactions. Every block is linked to the previous one using cryptographic hashes.

- **Block Structure**  
  Each block will contain:
  - **Index** (Position of the block in the chain)
  - **Timestamp** (When the block was created)
  - **Transactions** (List of transactions in the block)
  - **Previous Hash** (Hash of the previous block)
  - **Merkle Root** (Hash of all transactions)
  - **Nonce** (Random number used for PoW)
  - **Hash** (SHA-256 hash of the block)

---

### **2. Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)**
You'll need to implement a consensus algorithm:

#### **(A) Proof of Work (PoW)**
- Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle by finding a hash with a specific number of leading zeros.
- Uses computational power to validate transactions and add blocks.

#### **(B) Proof of Stake (PoS)**
- Validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold.
- Less energy-consuming but requires staking logic.

For simplicity, you can start with **PoW** and later implement **PoS**.

### **3. Transactions & Wallet System**
Your blockchain will support transactions between users.

#### **Transactions**
- Structure:
  ```go
  type Transaction struct {
      Sender    string
      Receiver  string
      Amount    float64
      Signature string
  }
  ```
- Transactions are signed using **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)**.
- Use **Merkle Trees** to efficiently validate transactions in blocks.

#### **Wallet System**
- Each user will have a wallet with:
  - **Public Key** (Wallet Address)
  - **Private Key** (For signing transactions)
- **Digital Signatures** ensure that only the owner of the wallet can send funds.

---

### **4. Block Validation & Chain Synchronization**
- Each block must be validated before being added to the chain.
- Nodes in the network should sync their copies of the blockchain.

---

### **5. P2P Network for Decentralization**
- Use **Go net package** and **gRPC** for peer-to-peer (P2P) communication.
- Nodes can:
  - Discover and connect to peers.
  - Share new transactions and blocks.
  - Achieve consensus on the longest valid chain.

---

### **6. REST API for Interaction**
- Provide endpoints using **Go’s HTTP package** to:
  - View the blockchain.
  - Create transactions.
  - Mine new blocks.
  - Check wallet balances.
